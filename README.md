# Iris-Classification-using-Decision-Tree-with-Hyperparameter-Tuning-Pre-Pruning-Post-Pruning-
Iris Classification using Decision Tree with Hyperparameter Tuning (Pre-Pruning &amp; Post-Pruning)

ðŸš€ Project Overview
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset used in classification tasks. The objective is to classify different species of iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features
âœ” Decision Tree Classifier implementation
âœ” Hyperparameter tuning using Pre-Pruning techniques (e.g., max_depth, min_samples_split)
âœ” Post-Pruning using cost complexity pruning (CCP)
âœ” Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
âœ” Visualizing the Decision Tree
